# RetinalVesselSegmentation
  Retinal blood vessel segmentation based on FCN. 
  The modle is a U-Net, We replace Residual Double Convolution Unit with Multi-Fiber Unit, 
  which reduces the model parameters by 76.1%, while performance remains basically unchanged.
  
## Data
  Two open Dataset are used: DRIVE and CHASE_DB, and calssical preprocessing are applied: Gray-scale Conversion, Stadardization, CLAHE and Î³-adjustment.
  We extract 64 * 64 pix size patches from DRIVE, 128 * 128 for CHASE_DB, then rotate patch to get 4 times more data, then normalize input data for modle.
  
## Modle
  Modles can be found in src/U_Net2.py and src/MF_UNet2.py, proposed modle is located in the latter file. 
  Multi-Fiber Unit is defined in src/MF_UNet2.py. 
  It is based on group convolutino and shared parameters, multiplexers are applied to ficilitate information exchange between fibers.
